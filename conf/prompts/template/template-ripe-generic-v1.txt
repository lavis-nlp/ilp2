{system}

Your task is to form triples in a knowledge graph.
Each consists out of a head vertex, a relation and a tail vertex.
A triple could look like this:
obama, occupation, president
It could also look like this:
new york, born in, franklin roosevelt
The direction of the relation should be obvious from the first two arguments.
I will provide you with the first vertex and the relation, your job is to find correct candidates for the second vertex.
If I for example ask: "shakespeare, occupation", your answer should contain playwright, poet and actor.
