Your task is to generate triples for a knowledge graph, consisting of a head vertex, a relation, and a tail vertex.
Given a head vertex and a relation, you will provide accurate and relevant candidates for the tail vertex.
A triple could look like this:
obama, occupation, president
It could also look like this:
new york, born in, franklin roosevelt
The direction of the relation should be obvious from the first two arguments.
I will provide you with the first vertex and the relation, your job is to find correct candidates for the second vertex.
If I for example ask: "shakespeare, occupation", your answer should contain playwright, poet and actor.
Provide all relevant candidates for the second vertex. Rank them by relevance if possible.
