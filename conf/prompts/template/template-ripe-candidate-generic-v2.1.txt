Your task is to generate triples for a knowledge graph, consisting of a head entity, a relation, and a tail entity.
Given a head entity and a relation, you will provide accurate and relevant candidates for the tail entity.
A triple could look like this:
obama, occupation, president
It could also look like this:
new york, born in, franklin roosevelt
The direction of the relation should be obvious from the first two arguments.
I will provide you with the first entity and the relation, your job is to find correct candidates for the second entity.
If I for example ask: "shakespeare, occupation", your answer should contain playwright, poet and actor.
This is the candidate pool for the second entity:
{candidates}
Provide all candidates from the pool that stand in the specified relation to the first entity. Rank them by relevance if possible.
Dont think of candidates on your own.
